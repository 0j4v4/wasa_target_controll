!!!run wasa_target_control_gui

when program loads defoult opperating mode is set to "MANUAL"
recommended steps for operating is:
1. lounch software 
2. chose configuration source File/Epics
3. press ON/OFF button which loads config file and if mode is set to manual it will enable controls 
4. if one changes some variables in textboxes before sending command to server he/she must press "Set" button for 
   the textbox which was changed to set the variable
5. send apropriate command to server pressing buttons on left side of the software "
6. if loaded defoults are good for experiment just uncheck "auto/manual" selection checkbox to set operating mode to "AUTO"


operating mode "AUTO"
    in this mode server listens to cosy cycles pv variable, if it becomes "1" target will be set to IN_BEAM position
    if cycles pv variable becomes "0" than target will go to OUT_BEAM position which is set by DELTA_POS textbox
        OUT_BEAM = IN_BEAM - DELTA_POS

    !!! if gui turns off or you press "on/off" button it will not continue working

operating mode "MANUAL"
    in this mode software is not listening to cosy cycles. its fully operated by operator 
    all controls are enabled in software and one can set any position of target manually

    !!! be carefull with "MANUAL" mode
